# Session based WebSockets authorization for Nest.js

JWT stands for JSON Web Token. This type of authorization does not store user's data on server but passes it with each request

It is same good for casual websites, server to server communications and mobile apps

## Manual installation

I assume you have nodejs, yarn/npm, postgres, redis

First you have to download dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

Then check config in

```bash
nano .env
```

and start in watch mode

```bash
npm run start
```

or in production mode

```bash
npm run build
npm run prod
```

## Docker

Otherwise, you can use docker

```shell script
docker-compose up --build
```

## Usage

You can log in to the application using **trejgun@gmail.com/My5up3r5tr0ngP@55w0rd** by executing this CURL request

```shell script
curl \
-X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/login \
-d '{"email": "trejgun@gmail.com", "password": "My5up3r5tr0ngP@55w0rd"}' \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Also you can login with provider of your choice on
http://localhost:3000/auth/login

This will return your profile

```json
{ "id": 1, "email": "trejgun@gmail.com", "roles": ["ADMIN"] }
```

This will return a list of users

```json
{ "list": [{ "id": 1, "email": "trejgun@gmail.com", "roles": ["ADMIN"] }], "count": 1 }
```
